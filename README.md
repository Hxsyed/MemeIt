Overview
Description
[Description of your app]

MemeIt is an application that displays different memes(GIFs) to users. Users are greeted with the “Meme of the Day” when opening the app. They will be able to upvote and downvote the meme. The user will then be taken to a feed of different memes where they will also be able to upvote/downvote and save memes to their collection.
App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]

Category: Social / Entertainment
Mobile: View only, Mobile first, and interactive website.
Story: Allows users to view trending memes(GIFs) and vote on which meme is the best.
Market: Anyone can use the app, but mainly geared towards teen/young adult culture.
Habit: Users can see different trending memes everyday, even if they open the app for 2 mins to see this and close it, we would have achieved our goal.
Scope: V1 would allow users to see the Meme of the Day on login success, this should be different each day, not on app opening. Users will also be able to save their favorite meme of the day in the app. They should also be able to see a feed of memes. All memes displayed can be upvted/downvoted by users.
